# round-robin
A project evaluating the performance of five major optimized Round Robin algorithms.
The Algorithm folder has the Java code for the six algorithms: simple RR, Double quantum method, Fixed quantum with shortest process first, mean, median, minimum.
The Data folder contains the two data source we used for our two experiments. The file dataLarge.txt is the burst time for 100 processes, and the file test_q5.txt is the burst time for 5 processes.
